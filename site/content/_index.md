I work at [Analog Republic](https://analogrepublic.com) as a Lead Developer, working remotely from the comfort of my own space, making the most of our internal tool [Sneek](https://sneek.io) to keep in contact with my team.

I implement and work on complex web applications; utilising modern web tools and libraries wherever needed. I've implemented WebRTC, Web Socket and HIPAA Compliant applications.

My tools of choice are often React, Laravel, Golang and Docker for most of my projects.

When I'm not working I'm playing Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer 40k and reading or writing articles.

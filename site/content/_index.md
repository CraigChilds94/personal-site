I am a Lead Full-Stack Developer who enjoys building rich and complex web applications using the best tool for the job!

I've implemented and worked on projects utilising modern web tools and libraries such as React, Laravel, Docker, Golang, WebRTC and Web Sockets.

When I'm not working I'm playing Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer 40k and watching Baseball!

title: "Darkness"
description: "I enjoy dabbling in game development yet never really finished a project, until this one. I sat down one Friday evening, download Godot and just jumped in. This game is a simple arcade style game where you need to collect small orbs in order to continue to the next level, it gets harder as your vision in the game reduces into Darkness the longer you go without getting an orb."

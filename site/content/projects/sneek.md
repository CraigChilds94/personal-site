description: "At Analog Republic we're an entirely remote team, for this we like to use tools to stay connected and have open communication. The biggest part of remote working is the lack of face-to-face, we wanted to bridge the gap; learning from pre-existing tools that have since shutdown, such as Sqwiggle. On this project I co-lead development, writing backend and frontend logic to handle the WebRTC and WebSocket messaging."
